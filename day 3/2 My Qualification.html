               <p> My journey as a student started when I was in elementary school. I vividly remember the excitement and nervousness I felt on my first day of school. <br>I was eager to learn and make new friends. As I progressed through the years, I encountered many challenges, such as adjusting to new teachers, making the transition from elementary to middle school, and learning how to manage my time effectively. Despite these challenges, I remained committed to my studies and continued to work hard to achieve good grades.
